### Analysing the Situation

The aim of a migration project to LibreOffice is to replace Microsoft Office with the free office suite whenever it makes sense. It is therefore very important to assess the potential impact of the migration on every user, by analysing the characteristics of the documents with their templates, the VBA macros and the other automation tools, and the integration with third party applications.

In addition, the migration represents an opportunity to rethink all internal document related process, in term of templates, versioning, storage, and other characteristics such as the workflow process.

Certified professionals can provide the necessary assessment skills, not only to analyse documents, VBA macros and interoperability issues, but also to suggest solutions \(which include costs and timings\).
