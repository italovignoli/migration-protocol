### Lessons Learned from Successful Migrations

LibreOffice's feature set is more than adequate for the everyday needs of the majority - i.e. more than 90% - of users inside organizations of any size. In general, the few technical obstacles are related to spreadsheets using advanced features or to MS Office macros, which are often difficult to migrate for a number of reasons.

Users should be able to produce documents using LibreOffice right after the training: therefore, it is crucial to complete the setup and the test of the workstations before training begins, as any delay in the installation of LibreOffice will diminish the effect of the training itself. It is also extremely important to offer a reference point for any problem connected to the migration, starting from "technology leaders" up to trained support personnel.

In fact, the production of the first few documents will create a lasting perception about the quality of LibreOffice in the mind of the users: a smooth process will motivate them to continue and try new more advanced features, while stumbling into a problem - even a trivial one - will discourage them and leave a negative feeling.

The biggest problem, then, is the resistance to change, which is a side effect of the introduction of a new technology in any large organization. This it often seen as a burden in addition to everyday work, and has to be tackled with a carefully crafted communication strategy. Users have to be persuaded that the new tools, after some training, can provide a better and more rewarding user experience.

Typical reasons for resistance to change are:

* The fear of the unknown, which triggers the fear of not being good enough to deal with the new technology;
* The perception that the change is being imposed by the top management, which is not using the new tool to the same extent as middle managers and employees;
* A poor communication strategy: when it comes to a change management process there's no such thing as too much communication;
* A change of routine, which translates into a change - or perceived reduction - of the user's comfort zone;
* A low trust in the organization's, management's or personal capability to competently manage the change;
* A misunderstanding about the need for a change, especially from those who strongly believe that the current way of doing things works well... and has done so for twenty years!
* A change in the status quo, which triggers the perception that at the end of the process one's situation will be worse than before \(because the change favours another group, such as younger people in the case of old loyal employees\).

Of course, the "brute force" method - which consists in installing LibreOffice and eradicating MS Office without any previous warning - is the worst of all choices, as it creates a rejection effect which kills any hope of success.
