#### **LibreOffice Maintenance**

Once LibreOffice has been deployed on every user desktop the migration project is over, and the organization switches to maintenance mode. Needs evolve from the simple interoperability level to the development of new features or the integration with third party applications.

Companies providing enterprise versions of LibreOffice can provide code level consultancy and development work for any implementation of the software, which could include \(but is not limited to\): specific application features, read & write support for an unusual file format, document format conversion, specific computational needs that only become possible with better performance, integration and interfacing with a back-office system, and interoperability solution with third party software packages.
